# Technology Stack:
- The portfolio is crafted using a focused and robust set of front-end technologies:

- **HTML5:** Serves as the foundational markup for structuring all content, from the main sections to individual project details.

- **CSS3 & Tailwind CSS:** The visual design is powered by a utility-first approach. Tailwind CSS provides a highly efficient and maintainable framework for the overall layout and component styling. Custom CSS is used for unique elements like smooth animations and the dual-tone theme.

- **JavaScript:** The site's interactive features are built with vanilla JavaScript, ensuring fast performance without external dependencies. This includes a user-friendly theme toggle, seamless scroll navigation, and interactive elements.

## External Libraries:

- **Particles.js:** Adds a dynamic, visually engaging background to the hero section, creating a modern and immersive first impression.

- **Font Awesome:** Provides scalable and high-quality vector icons, used to enhance the visual communication of skills and contact information.

- **Web3Forms:** A serverless solution that enables the functional contact form, allowing direct communication without the need for a custom backend.

# **Key Features:**
- **Adaptive User Interface:** The website features a fully responsive design, ensuring a consistent and professional appearance on any device, from desktops to mobile phones.

- **Seamless Interaction:** The site's navigation is enhanced with smooth scroll functionality, providing a fluid transition between sections. User-driven animations, such as the dark/light theme toggle, improve accessibility and visual appeal.

- **Engaging Visuals:** Each section is introduced with a subtle yet professional fade-in and slide-up animation, creating a layered and dynamic browsing experience.

- **Interactive Skill Showcase:** The skills section is designed with interactive cards. When clicked, a modal displays a concise, professionally written description of the technology, providing immediate context and detail to potential employers.

- **Direct Engagement:** The contact section includes a streamlined form powered by Web3Forms, offering a reliable and direct channel for visitors to connect.
